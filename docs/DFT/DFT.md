# About K-points
When you solve the Schrödinger equation for a periodic system like a crystal, the solution can be broken into two parts: one that describes how the wavefunction behaves within each unit cell, and another that describes how it changes across unit cells. The k-points tell you how the wavefunction shifts as you move from one cell to the next. At the Gamma point (k = 0), there’s no change, the wavefunction looks identical in every cell. As you move to small k, the wavefunction shifts gradually across the crystal, which allows you to describe a more complex wavefunction than one in which the same thing just repeats in each unit cell. At the edges of the Brillouin zone, the wavefunction can “flip” from one unit cell to the next, like alternating sign. So, when describing all the solutions to the Schrödinger equation, k-points basically allow you to separate it into parts that can be more intuitive to interpret(and calculate).
